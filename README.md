# # # Instructions: 

Clicky Game is a memory game application. There are 12 characters from Game of Thrones on display, and you must click each player one time. After each click on the character the character cards perform a randomized shuffle. If you successfully click each player without clicking on one more than one time, you win. If not, you lose and will get sent to the wall. Good luck!
